## Code Review for "groupAnagrams" method

Here is a review of the Python code that defines a class Solution and its groupAnagrams method.

### Correctness

The code appears to be correct and implements the expected functionality of grouping anagrams. The method uses a dictionary to store the anagram groups, and correctly sorts the strings to identify their anagram groups. The logic inside the for loop correctly adds each string to its corresponding anagram group or creates a new group if the anagram is not already in the dictionary.

### Efficiency

The code is fairly efficient with a time complexity of O(n k log k) where n is the length of input strs and k is the maximum length of a string in strs. This is because for each string, the code sorts it with a time complexity of O(k log k) and then checks if the resulting sorted string is in the dictionary with a time complexity of O(1).

However, the code could be improved by using a more space-efficient data structure, such as a list of tuples or a list of lists instead of a dictionary, since the keys in the dictionary are sorted strings that are repeated among the input strings.

### Style

The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python, including indentation and naming conventions. The variable names are descriptive, and the method name is clear and accurately describes the functionality of the method.

### Documentation

The code contains docstrings for the class and the method, which is a good practice. However, the docstrings are brief and could be improved to better explain the purpose of the class and method. Additionally, the code could benefit from inline comments to explain the logic of the method in more detail.

### Positive aspects

- The code is well-structured, with a clear definition of the Solution class and its groupAnagrams method.
- The code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python, with clear and descriptive variable names.
- The code implements the expected functionality of grouping anagrams.

### Improvements needed

- The code could benefit from using a more space-efficient data structure, such as a list of tuples or a list of lists.
- The code could be better documented, with more detailed docstrings and inline comments to explain the logic of the method in more detail.

Overall, the code is well-structured and correctly implements the expected functionality of grouping anagrams. There are some minor improvements that could be made to improve efficiency and documentation, but overall the code is of good quality.
